With your snorkel gear on, we can get you in the water quickly without causing any splashing or disruptions which often scares the dolphins. There are 5 boats that can be used for larger groups. Maximum 6 people per boat. For up to 13 persons, we also offer a Large Family Dolphin & Snorkeling Tours Panama City Beach. We do not allow pets on our boats.</p><p>Above, the dolphin became very friendly with a tourist in Varadero in Cuba. This is because dolphins humping humans seems like a popular attraction in Varadero. The video below will make you smile if that wasn't enough. Even the most cynical person will admit that dolphins humping people is hilarious. 16 May 2019</p></div>

<div><p>"We had a great day! Captain Dave was an amazing captain. He made sure we were taken to a spot that dolphins are frequent. Lucky us, we were able to swim with them, snorkel with them, and get to know them. It was a wonderful adventure that I will forever remember. I would recommend Dolphin & Snorkeling Tours Panama City Beach.</p><p>Private or public, dolphin boat tours can be booked in Panama City Beach. Many dolphin tours are private and intimate. This allows for a more personal, relaxing experience. The tour captain is available to interact with passengers, provide comfortable cruises, and allow you to get close enough to dolphins for many photos and videos. Dolphin & Snorkeling Tours Panama City Beach can arrange private or public charters. Besides dolphin sightseeing. Add snorkeling to your water adventure. Private charters can last up to 8 hours and can host up to six people. The average public tour lasts three hours. Blue Dolphin Tours offers both a public and private tour. The tours last two hours. Most boats can hold up to six people. A large family Blue Dolphin cruise will accommodate up to fifteen people. Local outfitters usually provide snorkeling gear during excursions. Large groups may love the brightly-colored, 73-foot Sea Screamer. It offers both sunset and day cruises. Every two-hour tour includes a 10-mile coast ride and dolphin viewing. A captain might be available to guide the boat for children who are accompanied by their parents.</p><p>Apart from being found in colder waters, killer whales have also been observed in warm areas such as Florida and Hawaii, Australia, Galapagos Islands and the Bahamas, as well as in more temperate water such as South Africa and New Zealand.</p> <i>Bliss</i></div>

<div> <p>Our Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours are limited to six passengers per trip. This lets our guests explore St. Andrew Bay in comfort, interact easily with the tour captain, and get a close look at the dolphins. You can take pictures, shoot video, and ask all the questions you want as your captain brings the tour boat as near as possible to the dolphins while being respectful and careful not to cause them any stress or harm.</p><p>Do not touch the dolphins. The dolphins will attempt to make physical contact with you if they feel the need. Touching one dolphin will cause them to leave the area. This not only affects dolphin behavior, but also causes irritation to other members of your group as everyone loses in the swim.</p><p>"This was the most incredible experience. The captain was wonderful. <i>Account</i>  We snorkeled, looked for shells and even swam alongside the dolphins. <b>Dock</b>  We saw so many marine creatures.

You are most likely to see them between 10 and noon and then again from 2 p.m. until it gets dark.</p><p>While dolphins might seem curious, some of their behaviors can be misinterpreted to mean they are friendly. Avoid engaging, following, or any other interaction with dolphins when they approach you in water. Instead, take immediate steps to get away.</p> </div>

<div><p>Dolphins are most active between 10 and noon and 2 and 4 pm. To spot dolphins quickly, a pair of binoculars or telephoto lenses can prove to be very useful.</p><p>You should make reservations with your local company in advance as spaces may be limited.
