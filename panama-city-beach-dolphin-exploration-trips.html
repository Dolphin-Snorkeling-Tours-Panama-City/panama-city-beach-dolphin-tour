There are many species of dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico, and eco-tours can be booked to take you to their territory.</p><p>They are usually not considered dangerous. While they are generally not aggressive, sea lions can be quite docile and keep to themselves. But as wild animals over 600 lbs, they should be respected. Some sea lions have caused injuries to humans.</p><p>Panama City Beach is just east from Destin on Hwy 98. These beaches have been voted the best in the country. The St. Andrew Bay filters large amounts of sediment out and there is virtually no runoff from rivers in the area.</p> <i>Dock</i></div>
